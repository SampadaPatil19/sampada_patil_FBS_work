# 7. Program to Find the Roots of a Quadratic Equation.

""" Steps to solve:

Take input for coefficients a, b, and c.

Calculate the discriminant (D) = b**2 - 4ac.

Depending on the value of D:

    If D > 0 → Two distinct real roots.

    If D == 0 → Two equal (real and same) roots.

    If D < 0 → Complex roots.

Display the roots accordingly.
